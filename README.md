Loan Approval Prediction – Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

This repository contains a machine learning project that builds and evaluates a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model to predict loan approvals using a structured loan dataset.

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for binary classification using SVC, including:

Data preprocessing and feature handling

Train-test split

SVC model training

Hyperparameter tuning

Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

Comparison before and after tuning

The goal is to accurately predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant features.

🚀 Features

✔ Clean handling of missing values
✔ Scikit-learn SVC implementation
✔ Hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement
✔ Detailed classification metrics
✔ Easy-to-interpret results and plots (if any)

📊 Results Summary

The tuned SVC model significantly improved performance:

Higher accuracy compared to baseline

Better F1-score, balancing precision and recall

Improved recall for approved loans, which is valuable for business decisions
